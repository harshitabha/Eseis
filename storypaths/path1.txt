Hurriedly, I run down the stairs to open the door. Option A  *B* wait **, father dies, villagers dissaprove. regret and self anger builds spirit

"Father! You're back!" 
"Mezra, come here." 
Walking slowly, I peer at the other two villagers accompanying my father. I greet them politely then turn to my father. 
"What-?" I stutter..
I look at my father, who graduated from the academy of knights at the age of 23. A long strip of bandages was wrapped around him. They were already drenched with blood.
