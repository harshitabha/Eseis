Mezra Arak was a commoner living in the Mavian Forest in the island.  Her father injured during an adventure and when he arrives home, he soon dies. When he dies, he leaves behind 3 green cores and 1 blue core.  At exploring her father’s room, she finds an amethyst necklace with a note.
We live in the outskirts of Mavian forest, next to the nearby City of Pinapple. When we left the city, we ran into this very group of villagers who gladly took us in at a vacant house.
